# Tetherchand

Tetherchand is a Node.js-based platform that aggregates and displays Tether (USDT) prices from multiple Iranian cryptocurrency exchanges. By collecting data from various sources, Tetherchand enables users to make informed decisions by comparing buy and sell prices across different exchanges.

## Project Idea and Purpose

In the volatile cryptocurrency market, prices can vary significantly between exchanges. Tetherchand addresses this by providing a centralized platform where users can see up-to-date USDT prices from several major Iranian exchanges. By collecting real-time data, Tetherchand helps users identify the best prices for buying or selling Tether, enhancing their decision-making process. The platform integrates with APIs from exchanges like OK-EX, Nobitex, Aban-tether, and others, standardizing the data to ensure consistent and accurate comparisons.
